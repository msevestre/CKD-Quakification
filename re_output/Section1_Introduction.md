The presented qualification report evaluates the the OSP suite's performance at predicting drug clearance in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients with impaired kidney function will often require different dosing regimens than their healthy counterparts. In the absence of clinical data, predicting the correct dosing regimens is challenging, owing in part to the fact that CKD is a systemic and multifaceted disease that alters many body systems. To address this, Malik et al. (2020)<sup>1</sup> developed a whole-body mechanistic approach to predict pharmacokinetics in patients with CKD. Their method has now been implemented in the OPS suite, and is the subject of the current evaluation.

This report evaluates the performance of the virtual CKD population on 7 compounds, replicating the evaluation done in the original paper by Malik et al. Section 2 describes the algorithm used to generate CKD populations. Section 3 evaluates the predicted effects of CKD on drug clearance for seven compounds: Gabapentin, Acebutolol, Atenolol, Gentamicin, Pindolol, Sotalol, and Vancomycin. Evaluation for each compound is split into two steps: an initial model calibration against a healthy population, followed by an extension to a population suffering from CKD.
