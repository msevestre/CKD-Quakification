Using the model from the healthy population from the previous section, two new populations, with target GFRs of 45 (30-59) and 15 (0-30) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, were created following the procedure described in section 2. Simulation results were compared to data reported in Blum et al. 1994<sup>34</sup>. The results are reported in figures 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.
