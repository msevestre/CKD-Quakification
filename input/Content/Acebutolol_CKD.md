Using the model from the healthy population from the previous section, three new populations, with target GFRs of 46 (32-56), 20 (16-26), and 9 (6-14) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, were created following the procedure described in section 2. Simulation results were compared to data reported in Roux et al. 1980<sup>37</sup>. There was very little difference in the predicted plasma concentrations across each of the three groups, and so for the purposes of this evaluation we have combined the three into a single population. The results are reported in figure 3.2.2.
